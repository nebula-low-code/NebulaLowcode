**【Nebula Low-Code Development Platform】Project Introduction**

Nebula Low-Code is a **low-code development platform** designed for **software vendors** and **enterprise development teams**. Unlike traditional standalone app-building tools, it is positioned as a powerful **"middleware"** development engine, aiming to inject professional visual development capabilities into **your existing mature business systems** with extremely low cost and rapid speed.

### 🚀 Core Feature: Middleware Mode, Seamless Integration
Unlike traditional low-code platforms that require a "rebuild-from-scratch" approach, Nebula Low-Code adopts a **middleware integration model**. It can be **seamlessly embedded** into your existing ERP, MES, CRM, WMS, and other systems just like integrating Redis or MQ, using frontend/backend separation technology (frontend supports IFrame/renderer embedding, backend supports Jar/DLL package integration). **No refactoring of the existing architecture is required**; integration can be completed in approximately 3 person-days, enabling deep integration with your current system by connecting users, permissions, data, and business logic.

### 💪 Powerful Core: Full-Stack Visual Development Capabilities
We strictly adhere to software engineering principles, offering full-stack capabilities equivalent to professional development:
*   **Frontend Development**: Based on Vue 3 and Ant Design, it supports building enterprise-level interfaces with complex interactions through rich components, flexible layouts, and visual event flows.
*   **Backend Development**: Provides a Java-like visual backend development language, supporting variables, logic, loops, database transactions, exception handling, and external API calls. It can handle everything from simple CRUD to complex business logic for core interfaces.
*   **Data & Integration**: Supports direct connections to various databases such as MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, Dameng, and Kingbase. It also features powerful external system connectors for seamless integration with third-party systems like Kingdee, Yonyou, SAP, and WeChat Work.

### 🔗 Key Capabilities: Hybrid Development & Unlimited Extensibility
*   **Hybrid Development with Source Code**: The platform supports exporting standard Vue/Java source code and enables bidirectional synchronization. You can tackle the most core, performance-critical modules with source code while efficiently implementing a large number of business functions using low-code, achieving **a perfect blend that breaks through the limitations of traditional low-code platforms**.
*   **Component Bridging Technology**: Through standardized configuration, professional business components from your existing systems (such as specific report engines or approval workflows) can be securely and quickly "bridged" into draggable visual components within the platform. This **infinitely extends the platform's professional development capabilities** while protecting and reusing existing technical assets.

### 🎯 Typical Application Scenarios
1.  **Enhancing Existing Products**: Quickly add "low-code customization platform" functionality to your software products, creating a competitive edge through differentiation.
2.  **Efficiently Responding to Customization Demands**: Empower implementation, delivery, and enterprise IT personnel to directly develop custom features on the front lines using visual methods, freeing core R&D teams from tedious customization requests.
3.  **Breaking Down Data Silos**: Acts as a "system adhesive," easily enabling data synchronization and business process integration across systems (e.g., ERP, MES, OA).
4.  **Building New Systems from Scratch**: Can also serve as an independent low-code platform to rapidly build and independently deploy professional business applications from the ground up.

### ✨ Empowering Teams, Boosting Efficiency
Nebula Low-Code is dedicated to empowering **"citizen developers"** (implementation engineers, testers, product managers, enterprise IT staff, etc.) by lowering the development barrier through full-stack visual operations. At the same time, it supports modular沉淀 and cross-project reuse of development resources, significantly improving overall development efficiency.

**We believe the best tools should integrate into existing ecosystems and unleash a team's creativity. Nebula Low-Code is built for this very purpose.**
